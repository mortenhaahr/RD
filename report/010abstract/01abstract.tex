\section*{Abstract}

This research and development project will look into how Clang can be used for C++ source-code generation. 
During this project, three different tools were developed using the LibTooling library developed by Clang.
The tools each show an aspect of tool development and the considerations which have to be made when developing them.
For one of the tools two different implementation strategies were used.
The two different implementations were compared both in terms of speed and in terms of development experience.
Through the development, a good structure for tools was developed. 
A good implementation strategy for complex tools was also identified.
Furthermore, the tools provide a greater understanding of the internals of the C++ language.
The tools improve upon existing ideas and provide better guarantees.
Through the tools, many unhandled considerations were identified.
These unhandled considerations can be discussed in the future and used for the development of greater tools.
