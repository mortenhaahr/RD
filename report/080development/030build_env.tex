\section{Build environment}

The documentation for writing applications using LibTooling such as \cite{MatchingClangAST, ClangTransformerTutorial} assumes an interest in building the tools inside the LLVM project repository.

% NOTE: ./transformer ../../input_file.cpp -- -I"/usr/local/lib/clang/17/include/" works for finding stdlib but is specific to the user
% Solution where providing a stdlib as should be explored using llvm::cl (I think)
