\chapter{Tool examples}
This section contains examples of implementations of clang tools. The purpose of the examples is to show how the theory described in \cref{sec:080dev:tool_structure} can be used. All the code for the examples can be found in the \href{https://github.com/mortenhaahr/RD/tree/main/examples}{git repository} for this project. 

Each example will be split into the four sections of a clang tool as described in \cref{sec:080dev:tool_structure}.
