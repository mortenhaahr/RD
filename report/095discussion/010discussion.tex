\chapter{Discussion}

Throughout this project, multiple topics of discussion were identified.
The first section is centred around the difficulty of navigating the AST and extracting information from bound nodes.
The second section focuses on the semantic considerations which were identified during the development of the C-style array converter tool.
The last section discusses the differences between the two implementation strategies for the enum-to-string tool.
