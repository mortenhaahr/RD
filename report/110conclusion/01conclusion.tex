\chapter{Conclusion}

During this project, multiple tools were developed using the LibTooling library created by Clang. 
The tools each presented different challenges concerning tool creation and understanding of C++ source code. 
Through the developed tools numerous crucial considerations, that must be taken into account during tool development, were identified.
It was shown through the tools that it is possible to both refactor existing and generate code.
Through experimentation with the two versions of the enum-to-string tool, it was found that using multi-step tool development leads to easier development and faster tools.
