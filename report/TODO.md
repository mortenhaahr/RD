- Write somewhere (not necessarily in this file) other attempts of using LibTooling for source-code generation
- Write something about the issues with C-style to std::array:
  - Since the functionality of std::array is a subset of the functionality of C-style arrays there are cases where transformation is impossible.
- Provide text for LLVM, Clang and LibTooling figures in project description
- Write something about how our techniques easily can be applied for static analysis as well
  - Instead of generating code simply report it e.g. as a warning
