\section*{Abstract}

This research and development project will look into how Clang can be used for C++ source-code generation. 
During this project, three different tools were developed using the LibTooling library developed by Clang.
The tools each show an aspect of tool development and the considerations which have to be made when developing them.
For one of the tools two different implementation strategies were used.
The two different implementations were compared both in terms of speed and in terms of development experience.
During the development of the tools, a common structure for tool development was identified and used. 
Through the development of more demanding tools, the tradeoff between complex abstract syntax tree search algorithms and complex data processing was explored.
Furthermore, the tools provide a window of understanding into the internals of the C++ language.
The tools improve upon existing ideas by extending them and considering more edge cases.
Through the tools, many new considerations were identified.
These new considerations can be used for the development of better tools.
