\chapter{Tool examples}
This section contains examples of implementations of Clang tools. The purpose of the examples is to show how the theory described in \cref{sec:080dev:tool_structure} can be used. All the tools developed during this project will save the results to disk, but as described in \cref{sec:080dev:tool_structure} other approaches could have been chosen. The code for the examples can be found in the \href{https://github.com/mortenhaahr/RD/tree/main/examples}{git repository} for this project. 

Each example will be split into the four sections of a Clang tool as described in \cref{sec:080dev:tool_structure}.
